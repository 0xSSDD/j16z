- Raw feed
- CourtListener popover that we had - where and how to fit, I like the way it looked
- Explore page
- posthog or datadog or sentry
- How does the analyst export this, where is the report creation, or send email etc, download pdf
- audit log page - for this will have to have admin / analyst roles - need to use an id management system
- Docs page, that explains all the terms like spread ev etc, and then j16z how it helps

- Inbox should say where its pulling info from for the user


----
- save notifications for later
- change priority for a notification
- think of what AI features can be added to this that would actually be useful - [erplexity ], so have a platform ection, and then an Explore section (which has AI features and news)
